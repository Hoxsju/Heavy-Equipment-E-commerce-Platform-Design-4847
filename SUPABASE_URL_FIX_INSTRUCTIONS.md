# Supabase Domain Configuration Update

Your Supabase authentication settings have been updated to use the domain `https://alhajhasan.sa`. This document provides information about the changes and how to verify they're working correctly.

## Current Supabase Configuration

Your Supabase project is now configured with:

- **Site URL**: `https://alhajhasan.sa`
- **Redirect URLs**:
  - `https://alhajhasan.sa`
  - `https://alhajhasan.sa/#/auth/callback`
  - `https://alhajhasan.sa/auth/callback`

## Changes Made to Your Project

1. Updated `src/lib/supabase.js` to include the new site URL in the auth configuration
2. Updated `fix-supabase-urls.js` to reflect the new domain settings
3. Updated `AuthCallback.jsx` to handle authentication callbacks properly with the new domain

## How to Verify the Changes

After deploying these changes, you should test:

1. **Password Reset Flow**
   - Go to the forgot password page
   - Enter an email address
   - Check that the reset link in the email now points to: `https://alhajhasan.sa/#/auth/callback?type=recovery&...`

2. **Email Verification Flow**
   - Register a new account
   - Verify that the confirmation email contains a link to: `https://alhajhasan.sa/#/auth/callback?type=signup&...`

3. **Login Flow**
   - Attempt to log in
   - Verify that any authentication redirects properly return to your site

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Verify Supabase Dashboard Settings**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
   - Confirm that the Site URL is set to `https://alhajhasan.sa`
   - Confirm that all redirect URLs are properly configured

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open the browser developer tools
   - Look for any authentication-related errors in the console
   - Pay attention to any redirects that might be going to incorrect URLs

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
   - Test in an incognito/private browsing window

4. **Contact Support**
   - If issues persist, contact Supabase support with your project ID: `kiuzrsirplaulpogsdup`

## Additional Notes

- Changes to Supabase URL configurations may take a few minutes to propagate
- Always test authentication flows thoroughly after making changes
- Keep your production and development environments properly separated
